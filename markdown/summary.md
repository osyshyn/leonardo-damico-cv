I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Harvard University, an affiliate of Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences, and a member of the Reimagining the Economy project at the Harvard Kennedy School.

In addition to research activities, in 2021 and 2022 I worked as a junior economist in the staff of the Prime Minister of Italy.
